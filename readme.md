# Vision Transformer for Image Classification

This project focuses on implementing and exploring the application of Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification tasks. Vision Transformers have emerged as a promising approach in computer vision, leveraging the transformer architecture and attention mechanism to achieve competitive results in image classification.

## Overview
The objective of this project is to investigate the capabilities of Vision Transformers for image classification and understand their potential advantages over traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By applying the transformer architecture to image data, ViTs aim to capture both global and local features, enabling improved representation learning and classification accuracy.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a standard image classification dataset, such as ImageNet or CIFAR-10, to train and evaluate the Vision Transformer model. The dataset consists of a large collection of labeled images spanning various categories.

## Approach
The project follows a systematic approach to implement and evaluate the Vision Transformer model:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is preprocessed, including steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to ensure the data is suitable for training the model.

2. **Model Architecture**: The Vision Transformer architecture is implemented, incorporating the transformer layers, attention mechanisms, positional encodings, and other essential components. The model is designed to accept image inputs directly without the need for pre-defined image features.

3. **Model Training**: The Vision Transformer model is trained using the prepared dataset. This involves feeding the images through the model, optimizing the model's parameters using backpropagation, and adjusting the weights to minimize the classification error.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using a separate validation or test dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess the model's effectiveness in classifying the images.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques, are fine-tuned to optimize the model's performance and improve classification accuracy.

6. **Comparison to Baseline**: The performance of the Vision Transformer model is compared to a baseline model, typically a traditional CNN architecture, to assess its superiority in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Results
The project aims to showcase the effectiveness of Vision Transformers for image classification tasks. Through experimentation and evaluation, the expected outcome is to achieve competitive or state-of-the-art results on the chosen dataset, demonstrating the potential advantages of Vision Transformers over traditional CNN approaches.
